This is a Python code for a function called assign_room. 
The function assigns a room to a person based on their preferred building, gender, and the availability of rooms in the specified building.

The code begins by defining two dictionaries: dubai_rooms and novotel_rooms. 
These dictionaries contain nested dictionaries representing the rooms available in each building. 
The number of rooms is set to 25 using the num_rooms variable.

The assign_room function takes in five arguments: preferred_building, gender, name, age, and phone_number. 
The preferred_building argument is a dictionary representing the building that the person prefers to stay in. 
The gender argument specifies the gender of the person (either "male" or "female"). 
The name, age, and phone_number arguments are used to store the details of the person assigned to the room.

If the gender is "female", the function first tries to assign a room on the second floor of the preferred building. 
If no rooms are available, it tries to assign a room on the third floor. If all rooms in the preferred building are full, it tries to assign a room in the other building (i.e., novotel_rooms if preferred_building is dubai_rooms, and vice versa). 
If no rooms are available in either building, the function returns an error message.

If the gender is "male", the function first tries to assign a room on the first floor of the preferred building. 
If no rooms are available, it tries to assign a room on the third floor. I
f all rooms in the preferred building are full, it tries to assign a room in the other building. 
If no rooms are available in either building, the function returns an error message.

In each case where a room is available, the function adds the details of the person to the room and returns a message indicating the room that was assigned. 
If a room is assigned in the other building, the message also includes the name of the building where the person was assigned.
